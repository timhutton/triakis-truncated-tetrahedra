[Triakis truncated tetrahedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triakis_truncated_tetrahedron) have the property of packing neatly in 3D space, if you have enough of them:

There are a few other shapes that fill space. [Here are a few symmetric ones](https://timhutton.github.io/2012/09/14/36313.html). There are [many other less symmetric ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeycomb_(geometry)#Space-filling_polyhedra.5B2.5D).

3D Printing
===========

Send [ttt_mm.stl](https://github.com/timhutton/triakis-truncated-tetrahedra/blob/master/ttt_mm.stl) to your favourite printing service and they will post you these:

Papercraft model
================

If you want to make your tetrahedra out of card you can print this template:

I got as far as making one before getting bored. Let me know if you manage to make more!
