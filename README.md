# triakis-truncated-tetrahedron
Papercraft pattern for making [triakis truncated tetrahedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triakis_truncated_tetrahedron), which pack neatly in 3D space if you have enough of them:

I got as far as making one before getting bored. Let me know if you manage to make more!

You might be wondering if there are other shapes that fill space. It turns out that there are. [Here are a few symmetric ones](https://timhutton.github.io/2012/09/14/36313.html). There are [many other less symmetric ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeycomb_(geometry)#Space-filling_polyhedra.5B2.5D).
